<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Tu-154 is a mid-range civil jet
aircraft. It made it's maiden flight in 1968, and the aircraft has
been operated for commercial flights since 1972 till now. In total
more than 900 hulls were built, with modifications. It was the first
aircraft created by Tupolev Design Bureau entirely for civilian
needs, without using an existing bomber design as the blueprint. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">For a long time the aircraft prevailed
in USSR civilian aviation. It brought civilian aviation of that time
to a modern level. Speed, power, comfort and impressive looks helped
TU-154B to find favor with passengers. With that stringent flight
envelope demanded significant improvements in pilot training.
Unfortunately, pilot mistakes caused accidents and crashes - 63
aircraft were lost. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">In our days aircraft is heavily used
and even still produced. Latest craft (model M) has been assembled in
2006. 3 more hulls are on order till 2011. But low fuel efficiency
probably will compel airlines to discontinue the orders, and the more
ancient B modification is scheduled to be put out of service in 2010.
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">The plane did not leave virtual
aviation enthusiasts cold. There are several Tu-154 models for MSFS,
but the best in visual, dynamic and systems modeling is the freeware
one called PT Tu-154-B2 by the Project Tupolev team. Attention to
detail, complex and realistic systems, controls and navigation
equipment which allow to use model as a teaching aid for students
made PT Tu-154-B2 loved by simmers worldwide. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">FlightGear flight simulator already has
a Tu-154 model. It seems like PT team has had a hand in making this
model because Denis Okan is mentioned among it's authors. Sadly, the
model is not finished and seems to be abandoned since 2006. Mistakes
in dynamics and lack of essential panels make it impossible to get
any reasonable impression about the aircraft. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">After discussion with the PT team in
2007 the process of porting original Project Tupolev Tu-154-B2 model
to FlightGear was started. Authors gave visual model (sources),
textures and sounds as well as permissions to modify and redistribute
them (in accordance with the freeware license, see end user terms at
http://fs-proteam.com/products.html?op=one&amp;pw_patt=catalog&amp;id=18
). 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Sadly, systems and dynamics well
developed by PT team cannot be used with FlightGear - the platforms
differ too much. That is why porting the model to FG required
recreating almost everything from scratch. There is not a single line
of code left in from original PT, only textures, models and sounds
remain.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.2in; page-break-after: avoid">
<FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">Model
controls</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">A joystick is highly recommended for
flight control. Besides general axes (stick, rudder, throttle) an
additional axis for spoilers is recommended. Also it is possible to
use several throttle axes for separate engines. We recommend to use a
joystick with fixed idle and MCT (max continuous thrust) detents.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Also, view-hat configured for looking
around the virtual cabin is a requirement. It is advisable to use
some key to center view quickly. Pitch trim is used constantly and we
recommend to use two buttons for it. Rudder and roll trim is seldom
used and there is no point assigning joystick buttons for these. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">If you have free joystick buttons left,
you can use them for differential braking. If you want to use a
dedicated axis for nosewheel steering only you will have to change
model's XML config. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">You must bind the weapon control to
<EM>fire trigger</EM> on you joystick if it is not bound so default.
A script <CODE>controls.trigger(0)</CODE> should be assigned to the
fire button (usually, button 0). The trigger is used for otto
disconnect. If you have diff brakes on it, they only get used on the
ground anyway. These functions will not interfere with each other. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">For your convience, you can turn AP to
&quot;stab&quot; mode (wing level and pitch hold) by key <EM>d</EM>,
autothrottle – by key <EM>Shift+d</EM>. Disconnect AP and AT – by
pressing <EM>Ctrl+D.</EM></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Press <EM>Shift+N</EM> to set &quot;nominal&quot;
(MCT) thrust, <EM>n</EM> – for 0.85 of MCT, <EM>Ctrl+N</EM> – for
0.7 of MCT. Press F2 to engage thrust reversers on engines 1 and 3.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">A wheel mouse is strongly recommended
for model control. There are many controls, knobs and switches which
can be operated with the mouse wheel, and it's much more convenient
than clicking. Usually, all mouse areas are highlighted with yellow
boxes when you press <EM>Control+C</EM>, but if the active area is a
3D object, it will be highlighted grey, which is easy to miss. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Model is only ever flown from the
virtual cockpit, there are no 2D panels. Virtual cockpits often have
problems with access to distant controls – that's why we made our
best to provide easy access to controls and easy navigation through
them in Tu-154. Most noticeable is the powerful FG Views system which
allows active virtual cockpit use. I will use the <EM>View</EM> term
when referring to the point of view. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">There are five preset views in the
cockpit: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Captain's view - press <EM>1</EM> 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Copilot's view - press <EM>2</EM> 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Navigator's view (center pedestal)
	- press <EM>3</EM> 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Overhead - press <EM>4</EM> 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Flight engineer's console - press <EM>5</EM> 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>It is possible to use default shortcuts to change views (<EM>V</EM>,
<EM>Shift+V</EM>, <EM>Ctrl+V</EM>) but it is not really convenient
since you have to cycle through external views as well. We use the
numeric keys because our model is made for soft throttle control and
does not need the standard FG throttle detents 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">In this manual all controls are labeled
with numbers and the first digit represents view number. So, if there
is reference to switch number 406, you should look for this switch at
view 4 (overhead view in this case). 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">The sim saves each view's state so it
is important to have a key for neutral view position. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Besides five virtual cockpit views
there is an additional sub-view. What is it and what is it used for?
Imagine you are landing the aircraft. You have to switch views from
instruments to the window and back quickly. It is not a big problem
in reality but quite an issue in the sim. Usually, instruments are
badly readable and changing FOV to zoom them reduces ground
visibility. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Sub-views solve this problem. Sub-view
is a set of fixed additional views, that can be activated with button
<EM>~</EM> (tilde, leftmost key in the digits row). After the button
is released, previous view is restored. Sub-view parameters
(direction and FOV) can be changed the usual way, but unlike ordinary
views sub-view do not save state after you switch to another view.
Default sub-views are preset for: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>captain and copilot - enlarged instruments panel view (the
	big three) 
	</P>
	<LI><P>navigator - central instruments panel view (course and ADF
	needles, UShDB and USh) 
	</P>
	<LI><P>overhead view - enlarged PU-11 panel view 
	</P>
	<LI><P>flight engineer - left part of the console 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">You can change default sub-views
parameters in the model's set-file to fit your wide screen. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Also, depending on selected view, some
objects are hidden. For instance, the navigator's view hides the
thrust levers to let you see UShDB and USh.</P>

flight control system. Control efforts of yoke and pedals are

effects on the controls.

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">ABSU output signals are fed to
electrically driven hydraulic actuators (RA-56), which are mounted on
the rod assembly. Thus, the autopilot is continuously connected in
parallel to raw yoke and pedal inputs. In automatic mode, the control
movements are mirrored in the cockpit. In manual control modes, ABSU
loads the control spring loaders in parallel with the manual flight

MET</FONT></FONT> 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">In addition to the automatic modes, the
ABSU pitch channel contributes to pitch inputs in manual mode. In all
modes, the longitudinal channel ABSU has a pitch damper, providing
the necessary stability augmentation. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Let's look at the workings of the pitch
channel in manual mode in detail. For a comfortable flight, the
aircraft must give the same pitch change rate response for the same
yoke deflection throughout the whole flight envelope and the whole
range of CG positions. The autopilot, affecting the traction control,
adjusts the effectiveness of elevator movements and thus facilitates
the flying. But where does the ABSU get the information about the
adjustment necessary? To answer this question, you need to understand
how the aircraft is trimmed. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Tu-154 has no separate trim tabs.
Instead, it's got a special device called MET (trim effect device).
MET is controlled by a rocker switch on the yoke just like a
conventional electric trim would be, and moves the control column aft
or forward, thus relieving the efforts of the column produced by the
spring loaders (actually the spring loaders move and the control
column deflects as a result). This in turn changes the loads on the
ABSU and changes it's trim bias. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">It is the information about the MET
angle that is used for the required amount of correction for manual
control. The pilot trims the aircraft in pitch using MET and the ABSU
calculates the desired amount of correction based on the position of
the yoke. Adjustment biases are chosen in such a way that in a wide
range of operating speeds and CG the G induced per degree of yoke
deflection stays the same. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Proper pitch stability augmentation
works only when the aircraft is trimmed in pitch. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">In automatic mode, the MET trim is
disconnected from the buttons on the yoke and the autopilot drives
the MET instead. This allows for continuous trim in automatic mode
and makes the system more responsive. When the pitch channel is
disconnected the aircraft remains trimmed. On this model, there will
be no &amp;quote;false trim&amp;quote; alert though and the ABSU will
revert the trim offset back to the stabilized position as soon as the
trim rocker switch is released. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">ABSU autopilot in pitch is engaged
using the switch 367 on the center pedestal. The stability
augmnentation in pitch is engaged using the switch 550 on the flight
engineer's panel. Autopilot is engaged by pressing the green &quot;СТАБ&quot;

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Tu-154 uses the TKS-P2 course system
for lateral orientation. The TKS consists of a few magnetic sensors
and two gyros, and feeds gyroscopic and gyromagnetic heading
information to various systems. The system has a dual GA-3 gyro unit,
dual BGMK-2 magnetic course units, magnetic sensors, alignment
controls and out-of-sync and failure warnings for all of these. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">A special feature of the system is how
the magnetic heading is devised. The gyro heading is used as a base
and then adjusted using the BGMK modules, and then adjusted using the
KM-5 adjustment modules. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">The TKS model is quite accurate, except
for the influence of acceleration on the gyroscopes and the errors
associated with bank. You can assume that on the model the gyros are
always stabilized. KM-5 adjustment modules are also not implemented
yet. Generally, modeling gyro drift requires serious theory work, so
this part has been postponed. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">The power to the gyros is enabled using
switches 411-415 on the overhead, and the TKS is adjusted using the
PU-11 unit (436). Let's look at the gyro alignment procedure in
detail. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">When the power is on, gyro failure
indicators (436-I, J) will go off. Further, when describing the PU-11
unit we will use the button codes shown in the respective screenshot.
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">First of all, the gyros need to be
aligned to the latitude of the departure airport. Change the latitude
in the scale A, by rotating the knob D (&quot;c&quot; is for N, &quot;ю&quot;
is for S). Switch B is provided for automatic latitude entry, on the
real TU-154 this switch would not be available and the navigator
would have to adjust the latitude to the degree by hand (in practice
this would have been done once at the departure airport and once
before the descent). 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Next, we need to align the GA-3 gyros -
main and standby. Typically, gyros are first oriented to the magnetic
course, but if necessary, on the real plane you could also massage
their output using the KM-5 units to account for magnetic variation.
KM-5 instruments are at the right of the copilot's seat (two round
units). You can access them from the navigator workplace. In the
center of the device, there is hotspot to enter the magnetic
variation. In this model, during normal operation the KM-5 is not
necessary. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">The usual alignment procedure goes like
this. The G switch goes to the up position, switch C to the left
(MK), and you press and hold the &quot;fast alignment&quot; button H.
At this point, the main GA-3 gyro will rotate and orient itself to
the magnetic meridian, using signals from the mag sensor. While the
button is pressed a tooltip will be displayed at the bottom of the
screen where you can see the heading of GA-3 gyros and their BGMK
adjusted output. In real life, to control the process of alignment,
the navigator would be looking at the USH instrument (337), but in
the model, unfortunately, this is not possible (you can if you build
a multi-screen system)of course, if you build multi-screen system,
you probably can). 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">When the main gyro will align to the
required heading (it will be the heading of your airplane), you need
to switch the &quot;коррекция&quot; (G) to the down
position, to align the second gyro, and press the alignment button
again. There will be a correction for reserve gyro. After the
completion of correction, When the gyros have been aligned the two
needles on the USH(337) instrument will align to the same heading
(there is an inner needle for the main gyro and a bug outside for the
standby gyro). 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Now that the mag heading gyros are
aligned, slave the gyros to them. Switch C goes to the middle
position (GPK). 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Now align the gyros to the magnetic
heading (adjust the correlation between the gyro heading and magnetic
heading in the BGMK). To do this, you need to press the fast align
button once more and to keep it until the BGMK output stops changing,
you should do this for both the standby and the main gyro (again
using the G switch in the up and down position). In real life, you
can see the effect of the correction on the IKU (RMI, 106). 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">The main gyro's BGMK output is fed to
the captain's IKU, the standby gyro's - to the copilot's IKU. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Before takeoff, after the aircraft is
properly aligned on the runway centerline, you can tweak the gyros
with greater accuracy since you know the magnetic heading of the
runway by the book. Pick the gyro you want to tweak using the G
switch, and then reorient the gyros using the F rocker switch (right
turns the gyro right and left turns the gyro left). The same
operation is performed before flying the descent so that your gyros
are aligned with the magnetic meridian of the destination airport
(the difference accumulates when flying east or west and can be quite
big - up to 60-70 degrees difference in heading).

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">In case the main gyro fails, consumers

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">In automatic mode, flap extension will
operate the stabilizer in sync - the more flap you extend, the more
stabilizer deflection will result. The stab control can be
overridden. To do so, open the lid 301, the automatic stab control

stabilizer manually. The thick needle on the gage 309 will indicate
the stabilizer deflection, and when the stabilizer servo is working

are always slaved to flaps. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Flaps are powered by the hydraulic
systems 1 and 2 and they depend on the pressure available to these
systems. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Flaps are controlled by the handle 451.
In this model, handle 451 is controlled by the mouse, you can also
use the standard sim commands for flap extend/retract. Assign a
couple of joy buttons to these commands for convenience. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Flaps have 4 fixed positions:
retracted, 15, 28 and 45 degrees. Landing flaps position - 45, in
some cases - 28. Take-off should be performed with the flaps 28 or

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Landing gear, like the flaps, is driven
by the hydraulics. In this model, gear extension depends on the
pressure in system 1. Due to the lack of failures in the sim
emergency operation from systems 2 and 3 is not implemented. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Gear handle 452 is used for gear
control, you can use standard shortcuts (<EM>g</EM> and <EM>Shift+g</EM>).
In reality, you would also have to set the gear handle to the &quot;Off&quot;
position after operation but it's not implemented in the model -
perhaps in the next release... 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Gear extension is shown by the light
board 311. When the gear is out and locked, three green lights will
illuminate. When gear is moving three lamps show red, when the gear
is in the lights go off. When flaps are extended but the landing gear
is not an alarm will sound and the warning annunciatior &quot;ВЫПУСТИ
ШАССИ&quot; will flash above the landing gear lights. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">In this model, all the three struts are
extended simultaneously. Extension failure of the front gear leg
above 400 km IAS is also not implemented. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Steering of the front wheel uses the
system 1, and is coupled to the rudder. You'll need to engage the
steering actuator (447) and choose the turn angle limit (448): 10
degrees (takeoff and landing), or 63 degrees (taxi). 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">The model does not implement the
free-castoring front wheel mode (when the actuator is disengaged),
this has it's effects on crosswind landings. It is possible to
calculate this using JSBSim, and perhaps this will be a priority for
further development of the model. Free-castoring nosewheel is
essential for correct simulation of crosswind landings. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Landing gear is modeled with a high
level of detail. More than 30 animations are used to implement the
complicated moves, along with some Nasal magic. Gear struts on this
model give a good example of complex Nasal-assisted animations in FG.
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">The brakes are dependent on the
pressure in the hydraulic system 1. As in reality, brakes will not
operate if there is no pressure in the system. Perhaps the parking
brake should be independent of the hydraulics - in fact there are no
blocks under the wheels in flightgear :) 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">As in reality, the model supports
differential braking. Assistive rotation of the front wheels on the
main bogies is not modeled though.

reversers. When the reversers are engaged, the special nozzle flaps
deflect the jet stream forward-up and forward-down.

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">To simulate the reversers we used the
ability of FDM JSBSim to deflect thrust vectors, which allows for
relatively realistic reverse, separately for each engine.

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">In this model, thrust reversers can be
operated by joystick throttle handle if the axis provides some idle
detent. When you move the handle below idle the reverse bucket
handles will engage. As the throttles are moved aft, engines go to
full reverse power. Thrust reverser state is indicated by the lights
579 G, N on the flight engineer panel. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">In the model, to use the reversers on
joystick, you need to specify a response threshold. The threshold is
defined by two variables: <CODE>/ fdm/jsbsim/fcs/revers-1-limit</CODE>
and <CODE>/fdm/jsbsim/fcs/revers-2-limit</CODE>. One sets the
threshold for idle reverse, the second - for the full reverse. By
default, the threshold is set to 0.1 (10% of the thrust lever travel)
for idle reverse, 0.04 (4%) for full reverse. Change default values
for your joystick in tu154-set.xml around line 378.

</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Fuel is stored in six tanks: four tanks
in the wings, and two - in fuselage. The main fuel is in the wing

<P>We will not discuss theoretical principles of navigational
computing here. Only analyze some flight example with use of that,
and own calculator realization, so as virtual navigator mate.</P>
<P>By request of our Polish friends we'll check out Warsaw-Berlin
route, EPWA-EDDT. 
</P>

<P>Planner also give frequencies and geographical coordinates of
beacons. As you may see, results have &quot;deg.deg_part&quot;
format, same to inner FlightGear, not like Jeppesen or standart
schemes that ordinary have &quot;deg.min&quot; value form.</P>
<P>In addition to flight plan we need Berlin variation, because VOR
beacons installs on lines of magnetic meridians. In case no Berlin
schemes presented You can get data from nav.dat file. Check, it's
must have (+2) value.</P>
<P>Let's start preflight checklist. Start simulator in EPWA. Open
tu-154B-2\Route Manager menu. That's normal simulator manager, we use
it as navigational base interface. Add route by points, from takeoff
point. If we add point data right, it's appear in list. Add names
that planner gives before slash, MRA for MRA/Mragowo VOR-DME for
example. By the way, You can add intersections here. It's not
obligatory to make some straight route from beacon to beacon,
navigational computer allow free routes.</P>
<P>After add of all points You can close route manager window, and
open NVU Calculator window by same menu. On first run window will be
empty. Press Calculate to look on calculated route data. On that
phase it's needed to check that waypoints added correctly and way
length approximate to expected.</P>
<P>In main calculator window will be enumerated great circles of
route. For each circle initial and final points will be indicated,
route length in km, course sets of takeoff and landing airports.
Length will be negative, as common in NVU coordinates system.</P>
<P>Now add variations. For last point value 2.0 in “Destination mag
var” must be added, for initial point set “Use current” tick.
Press Calculate again and check that angles in main window ganged,
and bracked values too.</P>
<P>Now choose correction point and add correction data. For that
route last part, № 5, may be corrected, on Tempelhof beacon with
52.4731N, 13.405389W. Add this data in lower calculator string. Add
great circle number in “Beacon for route” field, latitude in
&quot;lat&quot;, longitude in &quot;lon&quot;. Do not add “deg.min”
tick, because data in “deg.part_of_deg” format. If You are use
beacon data from schemes, set tick and use &quot;deg.min_part_of_min&quot;
form, without dot of some else separator.</P>
<P>Now press &quot;Add&quot;, and, once again, “Calculate”. As
You may see, beacon data appears in window, in final route part. If
all done well, and nothing confused, as wrong sign that could move
beacon in other hemisphere, we'll get Sm and Zm that give us vector
from last waypoint to beacon, from EDDT до Tempelhof in our case.</P>
<P>Ok, all data collected now. We can start engines and process
standart checklist. After startup and systems preparation, switch on
navigational computer, 383-Q on Fig. 8. Green lamp must lighted. If
not then check doppler's angle and leeway gauge (DISS) and aerial
signals system.</P>
<P>Open navigational calculator again. Set “Virtual navigator”
tick and pres “Calculate”, by that we activate virtual navigator
who'll download current data portions in computer on approach to next
route points. If You are wish to do all the work manually, You can
leave virtual navigator in offline mode.</P>
<P>Data for download in NVU presented in calculator window. S
downloaded in &quot;Plane&quot; or &quot;Point&quot;, ZPUdep, or
after change TKS compass system - ZPUdest, in proper given way angle
console, correction data in &quot;Beacon&quot;  an &quot;Map angle&quot;.</P>
<P>Little interlude. We can download data in NVU in complete manual
mode, by use of proper consoles. In real life real navigator do that.
In model some semiautomatic download mode available. Simple click by
mouse on selected route in calculator window. If some calculations 
produced right now, and we are already fly by active half kit of NVU,
then selected data downloads in inactive half kit, &quot;Point&quot;
counters, and selected route will be active after current route
completion. If no calculations processed then data will be downloaded
in active half kit, &quot;Plane&quot; and next route part data will
be downloaded in inactive, &quot;Point&quot;, by calculator window
route points progression.</P>
<P>thereby, we can download data in NVU from any selected route, on
Earth and in air, skip routes on need, and so on.</P>
<P>When we are use virtual navigator, it's needed process that
procedure of NVU data download before flight, to let navigator knew
which route data must be downloaded. Check that &quot;Numeration&quot;,
383-R is off, click on first route and see how current and next
routes data downloads in &quot;Plane&quot;, &quot;Point&quot;, and
&quot;Given way angle&quot; counters.</P>
<P>Now return to our flight. Taxi to runaway, takeoff. On takeoff
switch on &quot;Numeration&quot;. NVU begin to count distance after
reach of 180km\h speed. After takeoff and out to echelon scheme
completion we'll get nonzero values on &quot;Plane counters&quot;. On
climb we can head craft to route line manually, or left that to
autopilot navigational computer.</P>
<P>To do so: switch on &quot;Kren&quot; and &quot;Stab&quot; if it is
not switched on already. Switch on &quot;Navigational prepare&quot;
tumbler and press button lamp &quot;NVU&quot; on pn-5. Green board
&quot;Navigational computer&quot; will light on indicators panel,
white needle will work off downloaded active route way angle on
navigational routine indicator, position plank will bend to side and
will show Z, craft will start turn and then finished it out to
downloaded route angle.</P>
<P>After set on route craft will go on it. If You are turn virtual
navigator on, then route parts data will be downloaded in
navigational computer automatically. On 2km before next point
navigator will notify &quot;Approach to next route point&quot;, by
voice. To let navigational computer half kit change, we must set turn
anticipating by selector 383-N. Real  anticipating depends on speed
and bend sharpness, angle difference of route parts. Incorrect
anticipating may lead to additional turn on route parts change.</P>
<P>If selector 383-N stays in &quot;Off&quot; position then route
parts data change will be not processed, and virtual navigator will
be switched off too. If You are set selector to last left position
then change will be processed manually.</P>
<P>In process of flight we must set radio systems and control
progress on many navigational information sources. Navigation must be
integrated. Correction on last route part already planned. After set
on that part, correction parameters must be downloaded in active half
kit, in &quot;Beacon&quot; counters must be loaded beacon
coordinates. If it not presented, as example, because of virtual
navigator error, then it's needed to add it manually, by switching of
383-M selector in Sm, then Zm position, and setting coordinates data
by 383 T-V buttons. U button multiply step of adding data on ten, map
angle adds by 340 console.</P>
<P>In real life, navigational computer can be corrected only be RSBN,
radio tech system or closer navigation beacons, that system was
installed only on exUSSR territory. Moreover, in present time civil
RSBN stations is out of operation and changed to VOR-DME stations.
RSBN system, as it expected, will be used only in military purposes.</P>
<P>Original RSBN system use not frequencies, but fixed channels. Two
verniers on 438 console let choose up to 40 of that. But in model
there's possible to use VOR beacons to correction. To move RSBN to
work with VOR beacons, it's needed to switch 424 tumbler. In that
mode, left knob of 438 console set megahertz, right set kilohertz of
frequency. Selected frequency is up in hint string. In real life RSBN
receiver could not work with VOR signals, but that opportunity
presented in model. Imagine that on Soviet forces departure one RSBN
beacon was forgotten, and it continue to work, camouflaged as VOR-DME
Tempelhof beacon. :)</P>
<P>It's needed to tune on selected beacon. Tempelhof beacon frequency
is 114.1 Mhz. Switch on tumbler 423, and set 114.100 frequency by
console knobs, guided by hint string. If we are tuned correctly, then
azimuth and distance indicator 321 will revive. Indicator will show
to us radial relative to true meridian, RSBN beacons oriented like
that, and distance. To copy distance on commander indicator, set 120
selector in middle position.</P>
<P>If all correction data, Sm, Zm, correction angle, downloaded into
navigational computer, craft is on correct great circle and RSBN is
tuned then we are ready for correction.</P>
<P>Switch on &quot;Correction&quot; tumbler 383-S. If RSBN signal is
presented then green light 383-P will light on. &quot;Plane&quot;
active great circle counters, that was spin slowly, will spin faster,
and after few seconds, slower again on common speed. It's possible
that nonzero Z value will appear with that process, and, as result,
craft will start bend and compensate correction error by that.</P>
<P>Switch off &quot;Correction&quot; tumbler. That's all, correction
processed. Beacon signal enter the navigational computer, and
accumulated reckoning error was eliminated. Craft complete bend an
set on new right trajectory.</P>
<P>If some error was made on data enter process then, on most cases,
reckoning process will be destroyed completely, and flight could not
be proceed on navigational computer no more. I'll be needed to shift
on another navigational means. And, yes, navigator error can cost
much to passenger and crew in some times.</P>
<P>It's recommended to proceed correction after course system shift
to landing airport course. It's important and complex flight part.
And errors on course system shift stage can make troubles to crew.
You can read about course system shift procedure in Project Tupolev
documentation, but in possible to simplify procedure in our case.
Before descent from flight level open navigational computer
calculator and press “Apply fork” button. If needle on
navigational routine indicator does not move to right position, it's
happen on slow computers, then change active &quot;Given way angle&quot;
by I-K buttons of 382 console, change angle on tick up, then on tick
down, on place again. That's all course system moved on landing
airport course, and, gyro course of course system will correspond
with magnetic course on airport after descent.</P>
<P>Then craft move on final route part, it's needed to set linear
bend anticipating selector to &quot;Off&quot; position to prevent
great circle change in last route point. After &quot;Plane&quot;
counters will count to zero Your route is over. Navigational computer
had take You to final route point, approximately in the middle of
EDDT runaway. You are not believe in that? Switch to outer view and,
if You done all correctly, You'll make sure of that on Your own. :)</P>

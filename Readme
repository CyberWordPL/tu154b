******************************** Tu-154b v.3.1 **********************************

Welcome to world of Russian Aviation!

Before use of model, you MUST read documentation: Docs/tu154eng.pdf - in English, Docs/tu154rus.pdf - in Russian.
There are Project Tupolev docs in Docs/PT_Docs for SVN version of model. If you want to get more information about plane and PT model for MSFS sim,
you should read it.

This is a very complex model, and it's not intended for beginners.

Unpack archive into $FGROOT/Aircraft/tu154b folder; under UNIX, you can place model into your home dir and create
symlink.

Install additional liveries: See tu154/Model/Liveries/README.txt.

Prepare AI model. When you go to multiplay mode, and another player will use Tu-154b model, your computer will stall for long time
(from 20 s to 2 min) and drop fps. To avoid this, low-poly model was created for AI/MP mode. It is included in FlightGear distributable.
There are liveries support for AI models, so you will see planes of another players with right liveries. For low-poly model to work with it,
install (or create symlink) your additional liveries into $FGROOT/AI/Aircraft/tu154b just as for regular model.

Install additional navaids: See tu154/Docs/Navaids.txt.

This model intend for FlightGear version 3.0 and devel. It does not support old FlightGear version (1.9.1, 2.0 or late), and

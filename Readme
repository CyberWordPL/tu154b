********************** Tu-154b v.2.2 *******************************************

Welcome to world of Russian Aviation!

Before use of model, you MUST read documentation: Docs/tu154eng.html - in English, Docs/tu154rus.html - in Russian. 
There are Project Tupolev docs in Docs/PT_Docs. If you want get more information about plane and PT model for MSFS sim,
you should read it.

This is a very complexy model, and it's not intended for beginners.

******************************** Installation ***********************************

Unpack archive into $FGROOT/Aircraft/tu154b folder; under UNIX, you can place model into your home dir and create
symlink.

Prepare AI model; for it, copy (or create symlink) AI/Aircraft/tu154b into $FGROOT/AI/Aircraft/tu154b. 
If you skip this step, model will work yet, but when you go to multiplay mode, and another player will use Tu-154b
model, your comp will stale for long time and drop fps. For avoid it, light model was created for AI/MP mode. There is
livereas support for AI models, so you will see planes of another players with right livereas (if you install theys 
livereas before).

This model intend for FlightGear version 2.8.0 and devel 2.9. It not support old FlightGear version (1.9.1, 2.0 or late), and 
you would not replace FDM file. If you want use older FG version, you may download appropriate version from 
http://yurik.flightgear.ru/tu154b-release/.

********************************** !!! *******************************************
Under UNIX, be carefull with register of directory name. After changing main SVN server at Feb 16 2011, name of model 
directory (TU154B) has changed to (tu154b).
